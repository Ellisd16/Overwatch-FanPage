            <h1>Synopsis</h1>
            <p class="outsideP">Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter developed and published by
                Blizzard
                Entertainment. Described as a "hero shooter", Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each
                player selecting from a roster of over 30 characters, known as "heroes", each with a unique style of
                play that is divided into three general roles that fit their purpose. Players on a team work together to
                secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of
                time.</p>

            <h1>Damage</h1>
            <img src="Overwatch-Best-Offense-Heroes.jpg" alt="Offense Heroes">
            <p>These heroes specialize in high damage output with flashy ultimates that are sure to impress. Most damage
                heroes have decent health (ranging from 150 - 250 HP), but their main role is to harras the enemy team
                with damage, forcing them to retreat and heal themselves. A good damage player knows when to intiate a
                fight, and when to pull back and help your team. P.S. - please stop picking Genji, Hanzo, & WidowMaker.
                You're not as good with them as you think.

            <h1>Tanks</h1>
            <img src="Overwatch-Tanks-1.jpg" alt="Tanks">
            <p>Tanks are the trickest to pinpoint out of all the classes in <i>Overwatch</i>. While damage and support
                have mainly one role respectively, tanks can flex around between any role. Some tanks can put out damage
                that rivals that of the damage dealers while others can support their team through damage buffs and
                such. Overall the tanks main job is to either push foward the attack or hold down the line. You'll
                always see them first, unless it's a ninja Roadhog hiding in the corner to pull you into the Ilios well.
            </p>

        <div class="pure-u-1-3">
            <h1>Supports</h1>
            <img src="overwatch.jpg" alt="Supports">
            <p>ONLY THE BEST CLASS IN OVERWATCH. THE GAME IS LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE WITHOUT ONE OF THE ASSHOLES. But in
                all seriousness, the support class is perhaps the most vital in the entire game. Their overall job is to
                keep their teammates alive throughout the match (despite the Genji trying to flank the entire enemy team
                alone). Supports are true team players, sacrificing the glory of the kill for the glory of the win,
                which is a much sweeter taste. Play support if want to win, but be prepared for the 148/150HP Tracer
                complaining that you haven't healed them yet.</p>
