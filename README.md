## Html & CSS
For the html of the page, I didn't do anything overly complicated. Alot of the format was actually dictated by the CSS Boilerplate that I used. Using the "Pure CSS" cite, I was able to create a grid based layout for my page that also included a nav bar and a submission form. I decided to make the page an Overwatch theme one because I thought it be fun.

## Javascript 

For the Javascript, I utilized local storage at the bottom of the home page to show the user the last password they used and to save their inputs into their local storage. (In order to see the last password you have to refresh the page)

## JQuery & APIs

Using JQuery, I made an API call to an Overwatch API that pulls data on some of the top players in the game! I want to explore the APU a little more and see what else I can pull!
