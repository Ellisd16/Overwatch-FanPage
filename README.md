## Html & CSS
For the html of the page, I didn't do anything overly complicated. Alot of the format was actually dictated by the CSS Boilerplate that I used. Using the "Pure CSS" cite, I was able to create a grid based layout for my page that also included a nav bar and a submission form. I decided to make the page an Overwatch theme one because I thought it be fun.

## Javascript 

For the Javascript, I utilized local storage at the bottom of the home page to show the user the last password they used and to save their inputs into their local storage. 

## JQuery & APIs

Unfortunately I was only able to use one API that gave me alot of trouble and took up alot of my time. On the Global Players page, I utilized an Overwatch API that would should the user some of the top players in the world, including their player role and their chosen platform.
